Id√©e:
  - Target practise (shooting range)
  - Moving targets
  - You miss you lose (if possible add three lives)
  - Three levels
  - Progressively harder
  - When you miss add buzzer noise
  - Time limit
  - If possible add target count down (targets left for the level), displays lives, level number, score
  - Make smaller targets worth more in later rounds
  - If level cleared bonus points awarded, if not just points earned will suffise
